    <h1>Meditation</h1>
    <p>When we meditate, we inject far-reaching and long-lasting benefits into our lives.<br> We lower our stress levels, we get to know our pain, we connect better, we improve our focus, and we're kinder to ourselves. <br> Let us walk you through the basics in our new mindful guide on how to meditate.</p>

    <h2>A Basic Meditation for Beginners</h2>
    <p>The first thing to clarify: What we’re doing here is aiming for mindfulness, not some process that magically wipes your mind clear of the countless and endless thoughts that erupt and ping constantly in our brains. We’re just practicing bringing our attention to our breath, and then back to the breath when we notice our attention has wandered.
   <ol>
     <li>Get comfortable and prepare to sit still for a few minutes. After you stop reading this, you’re going to simply focus on your own natural inhaling and exhaling of breath.</li>
     <li>Focus on your breath. Where do you feel your breath most? In your belly? In your nose? Try to keep your attention on your inhale and exhale.</li>
     <li>    
    Follow your breath for two minutes. Take a deep inhale, expanding your belly, and then exhale slowly, elongating the out-breath as your belly contracts.</li>

    </ol>


    Welcome back. What happened? How long was it before your mind wandered away from your breath? Did you notice how busy your mind was even without consciously directing it to think about anything in particular? Did you notice yourself getting caught up in thoughts before you came back to reading this? We often have little narratives running in our minds that we didn’t choose to put there</p>
