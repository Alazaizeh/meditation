    <h1> How to Meditate </h1>
    <p>Meditation is simpler than most people think. Read these steps, make sure you’re somewhere where you can relax into this process, set a timer, and give it a shot:</p>

    <ol>
      <li><h2>Take a seat</h2>
      <p>Find a place to sit that feels calm and quiet to you.</p>
      </li>
      <li><h2>Set a time limit</h2>
      <p>If you’re just beginning, it can help to choose a short time, such as five or 10 minutes.</p>
      </li>

      <li><h2>Notice your body</h2>
      <p>You can sit in a chair with your feet on the floor, you can sit loosely cross-legged, you can kneel—all are fine. Just make sure you are stable and in a position you can stay in for a while.</p>
      </li>

      <li><h2>Feel your breath</h2>
      <p>Follow the sensation of your breath as it goes in and as it goes out.</p>
      </li>

      <li><h2>Notice when your mind has wandered</h2>
      <p>Inevitably, your attention will leave the breath and wander to other places. When you get around to noticing that your mind has wandered—in a few seconds, a minute, five minutes—simply return your attention to the breath.</p>
      </li>

      <li><h2>Be kind to your wandering mind</h2>
      <p>Don’t judge yourself or obsess over the content of the thoughts you find yourself lost in. Just come back.</p>
      </li>

      <li><h2>Close with kindness </h2>
      <p>When you’re ready, gently lift your gaze (if your eyes are closed, open them). Take a moment and notice any sounds in the environment. Notice how your body feels right now. Notice your thoughts and emotions.</p>
      <strong>That’s it! That’s the practice</strong>
      </li>
    </ol>
